This is a project to help motivate users who had a stroke or a heart attack.

Key Functionalities: 
Record activity labels via ExtraSensory app
Tally up the hours they have been performing that action
Forward the data to their physician as a presentable graph. 
Receive feedback from the physician.
Warns family/physician about decreased activity levels over a period of time(2-3 days delirium) because stroke doesn’t happen all at once.
List of Screens: Login, Goal setting, Graphical

Our app takes a black box approach of keeping the patient’s identity anonymous.
Only the patient and physician knows each other’s identities. We would only use a hashed ID to correlate their data.
